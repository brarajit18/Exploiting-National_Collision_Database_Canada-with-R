# Exploiting National_Collision_Database_Canada with R
 A breif exploration of National Collision Database with R Programming


This project includes the following files:
1. MAIN_PPT_COMPACT.pptx
2. MAIN_PPT_FULL.pptx
3. Mini_Project.R
4. NCDB_Data_Dictionary.docx
5. NCDB_mini_3pct.csv (3% of dataset)
6. NCDB_mini_5pct.csv (5% of dataset)
7. PROJECT REPORT.docx
8. visualization_results.pdf

Please execute 3rd file (Mini_Project.R) to get the final results.

The database is named as "NCDB_mini.csv", which is a subset of main dataset. 

Full data can be downloaded from the following link:

Note: Change the filename of new data file, if you want to try it on full national collision data, or a newly derived subset of this data.

So the results in this data may differ from the results obtained from full data.

The results added to the project report are analyzed on full data instead of sampled data.

MAIN_PPT_COMPACT.pptx has 14 slides, and doesn't include some of the slides from MAIN_PPT_FULL.pptx.
